# Flutter Secure Authentication and User Management

## Introduction

This Flutter project focuses on implementing a robust authentication and user management system,
ensuring the security and privacy of user data through various measures including Firebase email
login and verification,
biometric authentication, unit testing, and AES encryption before storing data.
The project also incorporates Auth 2.0 for seamless third-party authentication and authorization.

## Features Implemented

1. **Firebase Email Login and Verification:**
    - Users can sign up and log in using their email addresses.
    - Email verification is enforced to ensure the validity of user accounts and enhance security.

2. **Biometric Authentication:**
    - Biometric authentication methods such as fingerprint and face ID are integrated for secure and
      convenient user authentication.

3. **Auth 2.0 Integration:**
    - Auth 2.0 authorization framework is integrated to support third-party authentication and
      authorization.

4. **Encryption:**
    - Sensitive user data is encrypted using AES encryption before storing it.
    - This ensures data privacy and confidentiality, mitigating the risk of unauthorized access to
      sensitive information.

## Implementation Details

1. **Firebase Authentication:**
    - Firebase Authentication is utilized for email login and verification.

2. **Biometric Authentication:**
    - Biometric authentication is employed to integrate fingerprint and face ID
      authentication.
    - This feature enhances security by providing an additional layer of authentication using
      biometric data.

3. **Auth 2.0 Implementation:**
    - Auth 2.0 is integrated into the application to support third-party authentication and
      authorization.
    - This allows users to sign in using their existing accounts on platforms such as Google,
      ensuring a seamless authentication experience.

4. **AES Encryption:**
    - AES encryption algorithm is implemented to encrypt sensitive user data before storage.
    - This ensures that even if the data is compromised, it remains encrypted and unreadable without
      the decryption key.

## Testing

1. **Unit Testing:**
    - Unit tests are implemented to ensure the functionality and reliability of individual
      components of the application.
    - Unit testing helps identify and fix potential issues early in the development process,
      ensuring a robust and stable application.

## Documentation

1. **Code Documentation:**
    - The project maintains comprehensive documentation for classes and methods to ensure code
      readability, maintainability, and understanding.
    - Each class and method is extensively documented with detailed explanations of their
      functionalities, parameters, return types, and usage.
    - The documentation follows a consistent format, making it easier for developers to navigate and
      comprehend the codebase effectively.
    - By adhering to best practices in code documentation, the project promotes collaboration,
      reduces bugs, and facilitates future enhancements.

## Usage Instructions

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Ensure Flutter SDK is installed on your system.
3. Run the application on an emulator or physical device to test the features.
